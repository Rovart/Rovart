# Hi there, I'm Roberto 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a developer passionate about **privacy-first technology** and **high-performance software**. I believe in building tools that respect user privacy and run entirely on your own machine—no cloud required.

### 🎵 Vibecoding Philosophy

I'm a strong advocate of **vibecoding**—the art of coding in flow state, where creativity meets productivity. I leverage AI tools as collaborative coding partners, not replacements. My workflow:

- 🤖 **AI-Augmented Development** - Using AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, local LLMs) to accelerate iteration and explore possibilities
- 🎯 **Human-Led Architecture** - AI suggests, humans decide. Critical thinking and design decisions remain human-driven
- ⚡ **Rapid Prototyping** - Vibecoding enables fast experimentation and iteration cycles
- 🧠 **Continuous Learning** - AI helps me explore new patterns, languages, and frameworks efficiently
- 🎨 **Creative Flow** - Finding the perfect balance between deep focus and AI-assisted productivity

I believe in **responsible AI usage**: using it to amplify human creativity and capability, while maintaining code quality, understanding, and ownership.
